# Mobile-Sales-Dashboard
PowerBi Dashboard

The Mobile Sales Analytics Dashboard is developed using Power BI to analyze and visualize mobile phone sales data. It converts raw transactional data into interactive reports that help stakeholders understand sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends for better decision-making.

The dashboard tracks key performance indicators such as total sales revenue, total units sold, average selling price, top-performing brands and models, and region-wise sales contribution. Interactive charts, slicers, and filters allow users to explore trends across time, brands, and locations.

Data is cleaned and transformed using Power Query, while DAX is used to create calculated measures and KPIs. Proper data modeling ensures accurate and efficient analysis.

This dashboard provides insights into high-performing products, seasonal sales patterns, and customer preferences, supporting inventory planning and sales strategy. The project is created for academic and learning purposes using Power BI Desktop.
